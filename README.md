    • screenshot-2014.png
    • screenshot-2015.png
    • screenshot-2016.png
  > Text files of the VBA code:
    • Compute_Stock_Info.txt – the code that does the stock computations
    • zero_all_sheeets.txt – a short script to clear the cells on the worksheets so the user can see the script function
  > The Excel file with the data and the scripts
    • Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.zip – I zipped the file to make it just a little bit smaller
    
To run the scripts:
  • Unzip the Excel file
  • Open it in Excel
  • In Excel click "Developer" then "Visual Basic"
  • Press the "play" button
  • The script will run, press OK and it will walk through all the worksheets
  • If you'd like to see it run again, run the ZeroCells module which will clear the output cells in the worksheets
  • That's it!
